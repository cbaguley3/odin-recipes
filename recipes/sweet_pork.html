    <h3><center>Description</center></h3>
        <p> I already know what you’re thinking. Does the food blog world really need another Café
            Rio recipe? Well, my answer is YES. A big fat huge YES because this Cafe Rio Sweet Pork
             recipe is phenomenal, and I don’t throw that word around too much. </p>

    <p> About 2 years ago I started making the sweet pork at home, and it just never tasted right. 
        So I’ve been experimenting with different versions and this one is the one we feel tastes 
        closest to the real thing. It is so sweet, so delicious. It literally melts in your mouth. 
        There’s no need to marinate the pork, like other recipes. I skipped out on doing it this time, 
        and I could not tell a difference at all. This pork is SO flavorful! It’s perfect in burritos, 
        tacos and salads. We love to place a tortilla on a plate, then top it with black beans, rice 
        and the sweet pork, just like Café Rio does.

    <h3><center>Ingredients</center></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pound pork shoulder/butt roast</li>
        <li>16 ounces Coca-Cola soda, divided ( do not use diet soda. You need the regular soda for the sugar in it)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 can (4 ounces) diced green chilies</li>
        <li>1 can (10 ounces) red enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
      </ul>
      

    <h3><center>Preparation Steps</center></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Spray inside of a large crock pot with cooking spray. Place pork roast inside. Pour 8 ounces of Coca-Cola 
            ( I used a measuring cup) and water around pork. (It does not need to cover roast)</li>
        <li>Sprinkle evenly with garlic salt, salt and pepper. Cover with lid and cook on high heat for 6 hours OR 
            cook on low heat for 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove pork from crock pot and transfer to cutting board. Discard liquid from crock pot. Shred pork with 
            two forks, and remove any fat.</li>
        <li>In a blender or food processor, blend the remaining 8 ounces Coca-Cola, diced green chilies, enchilada 
            sauce and brown sugar. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Place shredded pork back in crock pot. Pour enchilada sauce mixture over the shredded pork. Cover 
            crock pot with lid and cook another 1 to 2 hours on low heat.</li>
        <li>Serve pork in burritos, salads and tacos!</li>
      </ol>
