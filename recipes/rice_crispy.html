    <p> I spend days and days trying to come up with the perfect cake. Or the most beautiful cupcakes. 
        Or to create the fudgiest brownies. But, it’s no secret, Rice Krispie Treats have always been 
        the key to my heart. Knowing how to make rice krispie treats has gotten me far in life. </p>

    <p> It’s the classic, original, homemade RICE KRISPIE TREAT that draws me in.
        The biggest question is how to spell it. Some people say Rice Crispy, Some 
        say Crispy Rice, some say Rice Crispies. Either way, you get the point!.</p>
